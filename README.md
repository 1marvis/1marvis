# Hi there, welcome to my github profile page. 
**This page contains a short description about me and what I do:**
1. My name is **Marvis** and, I am an aspiring Software engineer:
- Currently studying under Cogrammar in partnership with Hyperiondev.

2. I plan to regularly push updates of programs I write, to my page
- This include pieces of programs I write during the course of my learning <br /> and ultimately, my portfolio projects.
- I also plan to take on personal projects, as I progress and understand more about Software development.

*I promise to regularly revisit this page and update it, as I understand more about technologies, and also as I progress!*
